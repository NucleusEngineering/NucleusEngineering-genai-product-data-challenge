# Welcome to the generative AI product data challenge!


## Motivation

This project aims to use the [Best Buy open data set](https://github.com/BestBuyAPIs/open-data-set) as a basis of a generative AI use-case.


## Requirements

### Set up your local development environment

Skip this step, if you are using **Vertex AI Workbench Notebooks**, your environment already meets all the requirements to run this notebook.

Otherwise, **make sure your environment meets this notebook's requirements**. You need the following:

- Git
- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)
- Python 3
- virtualenv
- Jupyter notebook running in a virtual environment with Python 3
- The Google Cloud guide to [Setting up a Python development environment](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup) and the [Jupyter installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install) provide detailed instructions for meeting these requirements. The following steps provide a condensed set of instructions:

1. [Install and initialize the Cloud SDK.](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)

2. [Install Python 3.](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup#installing_python)

3. [Install virtualenv](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup#installing_and_using_virtualenv) and create a virtual environment that uses Python 3. Activate the virtual environment.

4. To install Jupyter, run ```pip install jupyter``` on the command-line in a terminal shell.

5. To launch Jupyter, run ```jupyter notebook``` on the command-line in a terminal shell.

## How-to

An explanation of the preprocessing, and introduction to the products data is provided in the jupyter notebook **Product_Data_Analysis.ipynb**.

Follow the instructions of the notebook, and you will find a challenge at the end.

## Enjoy the challenge, get creative!
